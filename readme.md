# QuikCode
QuikCode is a language I am working on, it is still in development and in its very early stages.
## How does it work
QuikCode's compiler is currently being written in C++ but if a better language comes up I may switch to it.

## Compiling
To compile from source just run the command to compile a program in your favourite compiler
e.g. minGW:
```
c++ qc.cpp -o qc.exe
```
